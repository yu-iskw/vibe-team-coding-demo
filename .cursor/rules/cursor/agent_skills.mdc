# Agent Skills Standards

Agent Skills is an open standard for extending AI agents with specialized capabilities, domain knowledge, and repeatable workflows.

## Directory Structure

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file and optional supporting directories.

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md         # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/         # Optional: executable code (Bash, Python, etc.)
├── references/      # Optional: additional documentation (loaded on demand)
└── assets/          # Optional: templates, schemas, static resources
```

### Standard Locations
- `.cursor/skills/`: Project-level skills
- `.claude/skills/`: Project-level (Claude compatibility)
- `~/.cursor/skills/`: User-level (global)

## SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content.

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when the agent should use it.
---

# Skill Title

## When to Use
- Use this skill when...
- This skill is helpful for...

## Instructions
1. Step-by-step guidance for the agent.
2. Reference scripts using relative paths: `scripts/my-script.sh`.
```

### Frontmatter Fields
- `name`: Max 64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only. Must match directory name.
- `description`: Max 1024 chars. Critical for the agent to identify when the skill is relevant.
- `disable-model-invocation`: (Optional) Set to `true` to require explicit `/skill-name` trigger.

## Orchestration-Friendly Skills

When designing skills for a multi-agent environment (orchestration):

- **Modularity**: Design skills to perform single, atomic actions that specialized agents can call.
- **Structured Results**: Skills should return clear, structured output (e.g., JSON or well-formatted text) that can be easily parsed and compiled by a coordinator agent.
- **Atomic Execution**: Avoid side effects that depend on state across multiple skill calls if possible.

## Best Practices

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Keep `SKILL.md` concise (< 500 lines). Move detailed reference material to the `references/` directory to save context tokens.
- **Self-Contained Scripts**: Ensure scripts in `scripts/` handle their own dependencies or clearly document requirements.
- **Context Isolation**: Use skills for single-purpose, repeatable tasks that don't require a separate context window (unlike subagents).
- **Tool Usage**: Skills can guide the agent to use existing tools (Shell, Read, etc.) more effectively for specific domains.
